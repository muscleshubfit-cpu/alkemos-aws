/**
 * AI RUNNER PUSH-DISPATCH (event-driven queue trigger).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-28 incident, owner: «توليد الخطط لا يعمل»):
 * the process-ai-jobs.yml worker is a GitHub cron (every 10 min) — but GitHub
 * silently de-registered ALL scheduled workflows in this repo (Phase 18
 * forensics: 0 scheduled fires repo-wide since 2026-08-26, the API-enable
 * remedy did NOT restore firing). The worker had exactly ONE run ever
 * (a manual dispatch) → every plan_nutrition / plan_workout / article_*
 * job enqueued after 2026-08-27 21:24 UTC sat `queued` FOREVER →
 * "plan generation doesn't work" while every line of queue code was fine.
 *
 * LAW (AGENTS.md §8): enqueue MUST push-trigger the runner. The GitHub
 * scheduler and the daily Vercel catch-up are BACKSTOP layers, never the
 * primary trigger. This module performs the push:
 *
 *   POST /repos/:owner/:repo/actions/workflows/process-ai-jobs.yml/dispatches
 *
 * TOKEN: GITHUB_DISPATCH_TOKEN (Vercel env) — fine-grained PAT, this repo
 * only, Actions: Read and write. Fail-OPEN by design: a missing/invalid
 * token must NEVER fail an enqueue (the backstop layers still exist); the
 * response carries `runnerDispatched: false` so UIs/logs can warn.
