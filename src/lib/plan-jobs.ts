/**
 * Plan-job registry + recovery — PURE module (no React, no fetch).
 *
 * OWNER DIRECTIVE (2026-08-28, T-4PILLAR-COMPLETE): coach plan generation
 * (plan_nutrition / plan_workout) runs on the GitHub Actions queue, so the
 * result lands ~10 minutes after the click. The old CoachClientView flow
 * used a blocking poll that DIED when the coach closed the tab — the job
 * still completed on the worker, but its result was stranded in `ai_jobs`
 * and NO plan draft was ever created. The client-side swap watcher solved
 * this exact problem for meal/exercise swaps (localStorage registry,
 * survives reloads); this module gives coach plan jobs the same guarantee
 * plus a recovery path for jobs whose registry entry was already lost.
 *
 * Three stores, all namespaced under the site-wide `mhe:` prefix:
 *   1. PENDING  — jobs enqueued and not yet materialized. Watchers re-attach
 *                 to these on every CoachClientView mount.
 *   2. SAVED    — job ids already turned into `plans` rows, so the recovery
 *                 card never double-saves.
 *   3. (derived) — the /api/ai/jobs?limit list itself (NOT stored here).
 *
 * Everything here is deterministic and side-effect-free apart from the two
 * explicit localStorage accessors, so the whole law is unit-testable.
